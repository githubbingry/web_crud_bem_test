Basically it's just a simple CRUD website using PHP and mySQL(my first time using them).
I'm pretty satidfied with it? 
Except there's still some problem tho, such as the id kept incrementing when u edit one of the row. Still learning to fix it later on..

I also tried making it in flutter, tho hasnt really implementing the CRUD function and integrate it to Firebase:
